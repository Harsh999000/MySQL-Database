# MySQL Database Server – Manual Linux Setup

This project documents a manually configured MySQL server running on Debian Linux with a deterministic automation and logging lifecycle.

The system is built as a learning-focused infrastructure project, applying production-style operational discipline on a local server environment.

---

## Overview

This server includes:

- Dedicated MySQL instance (port 3310)
- Manual service control scripts (start / stop / status)
- Master lifecycle orchestration script
- Automated nightly database backup
- Deterministic log rotation (date-based format)
- Log sanitization before archival
- Retention-based log cleanup policy
- Controlled GitHub archival of rotated logs
- Cron-based lifecycle scheduling
- Strict isolation from MariaDB and PostgreSQL instances

Logs from other internal projects are stored and archived here using a structured append-only model.

---

## Nightly Lifecycle Execution

The entire MySQL maintenance workflow is orchestrated by a single master script:

run-mysql-lifecycle.sh

This script executes all steps sequentially. If any step fails, execution stops immediately.

### Execution Window

MySQL lifecycle runs daily at:

00:00 A.M.

Other database families (MariaDB and PostgreSQL) are staggered to prevent I/O contention.

---

## Lifecycle Flow (Sequential)

1. Backup MySQL database  
2. Rotate logs to dated format  
3. Flush MySQL logs  
4. Sanitize logs  
5. Apply retention cleanup policy  
6. Force-add and push rotated logs to GitHub  

All steps execute in strict order using controlled chaining.

---

## Log Lifecycle Design

Active Logs:
- general.log  
- error.log  
- slow.log  

After rotation:
- general-YYYY-MM-DD.log  
- error-YYYY-MM-DD.log  
- slow-YYYY-MM-DD.log  

Retention Policy:
- GitHub logs: append-only archival model
- Local rotated logs: 14-day retention
- Cron logs: 14-day retention

Log files are ignored by default via `.gitignore`.  
They are explicitly force-added during controlled archival.

---

## Isolation Principles

This MySQL instance is fully isolated from other database systems by:

- Dedicated port (3310)
- Dedicated socket file
- Dedicated PID file
- Dedicated data directory
- Dedicated log directory
- PID-file-based process management
- No process-name-based killing (no pgrep collisions)

Each database family has its own lifecycle window.

---

## Environment

- Debian Linux
- Manual MySQL installation (no systemd dependency)
- Cron-based orchestration
- Local server laptop (non-public environment)

---

## Design Philosophy

- Deterministic execution order
- Sequential orchestration via master lifecycle script
- Resource-window staggering between database families
- Append-only archival strategy in GitHub
- Clear separation between runtime directory (/db1/myserver/mysql) and source-controlled directory (/db1/github/mysql)
- Infrastructure built for learning with production-grade discipline

---

## Purpose

This repository serves as:

- A hands-on infrastructure engineering project
- A structured MySQL server implementation reference
- A demonstration of database lifecycle automation
- A foundation for future hardening (secrets management, monitoring, alerting, remote exposure controls)
